# SESU-Web-Car-Registry
First MERN project with room to improve. 
The application serves as a web car registry system with JWT authentication that allows users to add their cars to the database and update information if the car properties change.
The system also allows users to upload information about MOT tests and repairs. Furthermore, car owners can put their cars on sale so that other users can view non-confidential
information about the car and the owner's contact info to arrange a sale. If a trade occurs(outside of the app) users can transfer car ownership rights to others. 
The app can be run locally and via netlify+heroku.
